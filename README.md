This project along with [flasher xml slideshow](https://github.com/foo123/flasher) were initiated some years back,
in order to create a generic slideshow framework based on flash for mostly work and demo purposes.

This project and (flasher) are still in progress, fully working nevertheless, but not developed anymore, the code is in a development state, with parts commented out here and there, as things were tested abd progressed.

**Note** for **JavaScript/CSS** and/or **jQuery** slideshow libraries with **similar effects** check out [NoFlash](https://github.com/foo123/jquery-plugins) and [Imagik](https://github.com/foo123/Imagik)
